# AWS Cloud Security Portfolio

This folder documents my practical AWS security labs as I build toward a Cloud Cybersecurity Analyst role.

## Structure
- `week-01-iam-mfa/` — IAM users, groups, MFA
- `week-02-s3-security/` — S3 encryption, policies, presigned URLs
- `templates/` — weekly README template
- `progress-tracker.md` — simple checklist of completed labs

## Notes
- No secrets or keys are committed here.
- All screenshots are redacted (account IDs, ARNs, IPs).
- Labs are performed on the AWS Free Tier.
